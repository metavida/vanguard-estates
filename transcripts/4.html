<p>After way too many text messages to decide on the best system, you and  your sister finally agree on a plan that can help look after your dad without making you feel like the villain of a dystopian novel.</p>

<p>The next week you head to your dad&apos;s house and unbox a small animatronic  cat. It&apos;s not trying to be super realistic, thankfully — there is no fur to pet or to clean up later. Yet its movements are eerily cat-like. You place it on the counter, and its long, graceful tail twitches. Your dad has always loved cats. You hope he loves this new digital pet slash guardian slash big brother.</p>

<p>Your sister calls him over to take a look. He leans in to inspect it. The robot&apos;s face, a curved screen with a cute, cartoonish cat face, peers back at him and blinks, waiting.</p>

<p>You prompt him cautiously: &quot;You can pet it.&quot;</p>

<p>He scrunches up his nose. &quot;Is this like one of those Pokemon you two used to have?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sort of, yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>He names the cat Missy. Missy already has a whole database of information about your father. Photos of you and your sister, photos of his old house, his old friends, his favorite football players, his favorite movie stars, his old cats. It can show these to him using the screen on its face, supposedly to help him with his memory.</p>

<p>He touches the cat&apos;s ears with his finger and the robot nuzzles his hand. Your dad grins, clearly a little surprised.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello Marcus! Nice to meet you!&quot; Missy&apos;s voices is clean, and only a little robotic.</p>

<p>On the other end, there&apos;s a human being watching, and typing responses. Missy&apos;s job is to keep an eye on him, make sure he takes his medicine, keep him company, and keep you and your sister up to date on how he&apos;s doing.</p>

<p>&quot;So how does this work,&quot; your father asks.</p>

<p>And this is the million dollar question, really. And here you have a choice. You can give him a generic answer – it&apos;s high-tech. It&apos;s an algorithm. Those aren&apos;t lies. But they aren&apos;t the whole truth, either. You&apos;re not sure how he would feel if he knew there was a person watching  him on the other end through those little digital cat eyes. But without  this thing, you&apos;re back at square one. So maybe a little bit of vagueness is in order?</p>

<p>So what do you do?</p>
