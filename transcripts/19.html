<p>You call your sister.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn&apos;t working.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not. He needs more and we can&apos;t pretend he doesn&apos;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what the hell are we supposed to do?&quot;</p>

<p>She scoffs. &quot;You&apos;re the one who doesn&apos;t like any of my solutions!&quot;</p>

<p>She&apos;s right, you&apos;ve nixed all her high tech helpers. You&apos;re the reason he&apos;s at home with no supervision. This is on you now.</p>

<p>So, over the next few days, you research. You feel weird searching for things like &quot;senior care not robots&quot; but that&apos;s what you want. There are  dozens of websites with profiles of human home aides. Some of them even  advertise that they offer &quot;the human touch,&quot; something robots can&apos;t. By  the end of your research binge, you have a whole list of options. All human.</p>

<p>The problem is, you can&apos;t afford any of them. The pool of qualified human caretakers has dwindled, and those who are left are expensive and in high demand. Vanguard Estates wasn&apos;t cheap, but it was cheaper than any robot-free solution.</p>

<p>There is a senior care facility nearby staffed entirely by humans that, at $6,500 a month, you can just barely afford if you take on a second job, and a second mortgage. But it has a wait list of two years.</p>

<p>But what else is there to do? You just can&apos;t leave him with robots; the thought alone makes your stomach drop. So, you add his name to the wait list. And you wait, trying to push away the morbid hope that someone else&apos;s parent will die, so that your dad gets a place to live.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
