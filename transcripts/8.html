<p>You tell your dad the truth about Missy. That she&apos;s meant to make sure  he&apos;s okay. That the camera in her eyes connect to a call center in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Your whole body is tense, waiting for him to blow up.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, so how does Missy know what to say?&quot;</p>

<p>You explain that sometimes there&apos;s a person on the other end, watching and replying. But sometimes there isn&apos;t. Basic conversations can be handled by an algorithm.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what&apos;s the person&apos;s name? The one on the other end of the camera.&quot;</p>

<p>You realize that you don&apos;t know. You&apos;re not even sure if it&apos;s always the  same person. You stumble through a non-answer, making a note to research the question later. Your dad leans into the robotic cat&apos;s face and narrows his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh. Well, hello there, whoever you are. I&apos;m Marcus, which you already know. It&apos;s nice to meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello Marcus!&quot; Missy chirps back. &quot;Nice to meet you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You already said that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I did, I suppose I forget things sometimes too!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least we have that in common.&quot;</p>

<p>Your dad straightens and shrugs.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay. Never thought I&apos;d have a cat again, but it will be nice to have another creature in the house. As long as it promises to use the litter box. Where did you put the litter box, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t need one dad, it&apos;s a robot.&quot;</p>

<p>He crosses his arms. &quot;Come on, all cats need litter boxes. You know that.&quot;</p>

<p>He has that look on your face, the one you&apos;ve learned means to stop fighting with him. He&apos;s insistent about the litter box, so you stop by the local pet store and buy one, even splurging on the fancy odor neutralizing stuff he requested. He decides that the best place for it is the laundry room, and you nod your head very seriously and agree.</p>

<p>On a call a few weeks later you ask your father how it&apos;s going with Missy.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Manny is great. He&apos;s a hoot.&quot;</p>

<p>At first you think he&apos;s just mixed up the names. Missy, Manny, close enough.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m thinking about going to visit him in the Philippines.&quot;</p>

<p>You pause. &quot;Sorry, I think I&apos;m confused, who do we know that lives in the Philippines?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Manny, the guy who speaks through Missy. Remember the cat you got me?&quot;</p>

<p>You remember the cat. You do not, however, remember a person named Manny.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, turns out he&apos;s a huge fan of the Marlins. Remember that signed baseball I had, that you kept telling me not to throw away? I sent it to  him, and he loved it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Manny. In the Philippines.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. He&apos;s the one who&apos;s always on the other end. We chat all day, it&apos;s great. Did you know that Paul Walker was killed because he learned too much about corrupt Filipino charities? Look it up, Manny says it&apos;s true. Anyway, he&apos;s great, a really funny guy. You know, I was skeptical of this cat thing. But it made me a new friend. Can&apos;t really say when&apos;s the last time I last made a new friend.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re not really sure what to say here. This is probably some kind of protocol breach. Manny is probably not supposed to reveal his identity, or talk to your dad about conspiracy theories. But your dad sounds genuinely happy for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>&quot;So anyway, Manny says I should come visit. He&apos;s going to take me to Fort Santiago, his brother is a tour guide there so we can get a free tour.&quot;</p>

<p>Your father absolutely cannot go to the Philippines by himself. But you&apos;re not quite ready to take the wind out of his sails just yet, so for the rest of the call you listen to him tell you about his new friend, Manny. Who does seem like a genuinely nice person. Who clearly makes your father happy. You don&apos;t ask your father if he&apos;s considered the possibility that Manny is scamming him. That he&apos;s not named Manny at  all. That this is some kind of trick. It seems harmless for now, and your dad will probably forget all about this ill-advised trip to Manila in a couple of days. Maybe even a couple of hours.</p>

<p>But he doesn&apos;t. He brings it up again, and again, and again. He really, really wants to go visit Manny in Manila. Imani thinks you&apos;ve completely  lost it to even consider the possibility. But your dad isn&apos;t going to live forever. You could take him on a trip to Manila. At the very least.  it can&apos;t hurt to consider the possibility, right?</p>

<p>So what do you do?</p>
