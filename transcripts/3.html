<p>You shake your head no. &quot;Sorry, we&apos;re not ready to officially check in. Can you just give us a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>The robot is unphased. &quot;Of course, please let me know when you&apos;re ready to proceed.&quot;</p>

<p>Its little wheels make a soothing whirring sound as it leaves. You focus  on that, instead of Imani&apos;s glare.</p>

<p>&quot;Please tell me you&apos;re not really doing this.&quot;</p>

<p>You can&apos;t. It&apos;s just… it&apos;s too weird.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s really going to be your argument? It&apos;s too weird?&quot;</p>

<p>You ask your dad if he wants to stay here.</p>

<p>&quot;Last I checked I didn&apos;t have much of a choice,&quot; he huffs.</p>

<p>Imani throws her arms up. &quot;We talked about this, you do have a choice. This is the best one.&quot;</p>

<p>The look on your father&apos;s face seals the deal for you. So you ask him to  pack his bags so you can take him home.</p>

<p>You do feel bad about this. Imani put in a lot of work to find your father a place to go. You should have read the documents. But your dad practically has a skip in his step when he grabs his bag, and that makes  it feel worth it. So you take him back to his house, a little ranch on a  hill.</p>

<p>Inside, the three of you stand awkwardly in the kitchen. Half of your dad&apos;s stuff is gone, moved over to Vanguard Estates. Imani is furious.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, now what? What&apos;s your backup plan?&quot;</p>

<p>You don&apos;t have one.</p>

<p>Imani found that place for your dad for a reason. He was starting to mix  the two of you up. He was confusing the microwave and the toaster. Physically, he&apos;s pretty healthy, going for regular walks around town to visit his friends. You thought the move to the facility was maybe coming  too soon, but your sister thought it was silly to wait until things got  really bad. Plus, if he moved now he&apos;d get that pilot program deal Imani found. You&apos;d never find another place of that quality that you could afford, she said.</p>

<p>Now here you are again at that same impasse. Maybe you can both just call and visit him more?</p>

<p>Imani scoffs. &quot;Oh, you&apos;ll do that? You couldn&apos;t even find time to read the shit I sent you.&quot;</p>

<p>She has a point. You fight about it for an hour. Dad goes for a walk, mumbling something about how he still doesn&apos;t seem to get a say in any of this.</p>

<p>Eventually your sister pulls up a whole list of technology she&apos;s already  researched for your dad. God, you think, she is the better child. She goes through the options – you could install secret cameras to watch him  yourselves. You could get one of those stick wheelie robots that you saw at Vanguard Estates for him to have here, at home. You could get him  a robot that looks like a little cat, but behind the camera is a real human, watching him and talking to your dad. That last one interests you; it&apos;s not purely a machine. There is still a person on the other side.</p>

<p>Your dad returns home from his walk. The sun is setting, and you have to  make a choice before you and your sister leave.</p>

<p>So, what do you do?</p>
