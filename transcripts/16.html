<p>You figure it can&apos;t hurt to do a little research into this Manny person. So you message him through your side of the app. He&apos;s friendly and kind and seems totally understanding of your skepticism. He promises  he really just likes your dad, and wants to make him happy. And when you ask the company to confirm that Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Abalos works for them, they confirm that he&apos;s a stellar employee based out of their offices just outside Manila.</p>

<p>They clarify that in general, they don&apos;t encourage workers to disclose their real names or locations, but they don&apos;t expressly forbid it. They tell you that sometimes, a patient connects better when they have some basic information about their companion. They offer to send you their white papers on the topic, with outcomes quantified, but you aren&apos;t all that interested in that. All you care about is that Manny is a real, bonafide employee who does not seem interested in scamming your father out of his remaining meager funds.</p>

<p>Your dad can&apos;t go alone, obviously, so you book two round trip tickets to Manila. He&apos;s over-the-moon excited about it, and you agree to keep your trip a secret from Imani, who will ask way too many questions and make you both feel like you&apos;re rebellious teenagers. Which maybe you kind of are.</p>

<p>Manny meets you at the airport with a huge smile, holding a little paper  sign with a picture of a cat on it. Your dad doesn&apos;t quite get the joke, but you find it incredibly endearing. By the time he pulls out a color-coded itinerary of all the things he wants to show your dad, he&apos;s fully won you over. You tell him about his litter box back at home, and he tells you about his giant family and how he got into working for the robot cat company in the first place. How he wishes more of his patients  could come visit him. How glad he is that your father is here.</p>

<p>Standing at the edge of a hotel&apos;s rooftop bar, you watch Manny put a steadying hand on your fathers back, while pointing out landmarks and his childhood home. They laugh about some baseball joke you don&apos;t get. They bend their heads together and whisper about some silly theory about  how a secret society probably built the temple they can see from above.  Your father might not remember any of this next week. He&apos;s falling further into that waxy shell every day, and staying there for longer. But for now he&apos;s smiling and laughing, he&apos;s made a friend, and you decide it&apos;s okay if he doesn&apos;t remember the details, really. As long as he&apos;s happy.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
