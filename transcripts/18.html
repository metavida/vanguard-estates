<p>If you can just fix this car thing, he&apos;ll be so much safer. Then you can deal with the rest of it. You decide to stay and make your dad dinner. Inside the fridge, you find weeks worth of vegetables that you were having delivered.</p>

<p>While you slice the ones that are salvageable, you think about what to do about the car. You can&apos;t just steal his keys. He&apos;ll notice. And you can&apos;t take the car away, either. He&apos;d be furious, and it would only make  things worse. Then, you have an idea.</p>

<p>By the time you&apos;ve put the lasagna in the oven, your dad has fallen asleep on the couch. You creep by and take his keys from him. Then you go out into the garage, and dig around until you find it. A small metal file. You spend the next half hour slowly shaving down the teeth on his keys, just enough so they won&apos;t work anymore.</p>

<p>You sneak the keys back next to him on the couch when you&apos;re done. You don&apos;t like tricking him like this; it feels mean and kind of gross, but the alternative feels worse.</p>

<p>At home, you call your sister to let her know what you did, in case he calls to complain about how the car won&apos;t start.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s kind of geniusâ€¦ I bet a robot would never have come up with that.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re quite proud of yourself, but it doesn&apos;t last long.</p>

<p>&quot;You know what would be a better solution, though?&quot;</p>

<p>Of course she wants to show you up.</p>

<p>&quot;Getting him a driverless car.&quot;</p>

<p>And here you are again, about to fight about whether to hand your dad&apos;s life over to technology. But this time, you&apos;re starting to think that your sister might be right. Or at the very least, that this argument won&apos;t die until your dad does.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
