<p>You can&apos;t bring yourself to keep this from him, so you explain what happened. He listens, as you tell him you don&apos;t actually know if he&apos;s part of the hack or not. You&apos;d have to look into it. His eyes narrow and  he stops you.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t look into it.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re not sure what to say. Your dad shrugs.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you told me. But, that&apos;s all I need to know.&quot;</p>

<p>You ask him if he&apos;s sure. You can talk about it, talk about your options. You would look into it, if he asked you to.</p>

<p>&quot;No. No really, it&apos;s…&quot; He takes a big breath. &quot;It&apos;s really fine. I don&apos;t  have privacy anymore, really. The robots see everything. So why not some random people on the Internet? It&apos;s not like I&apos;ve ever met them. So  can we just… let&apos;s just pretend this never happened.&quot;</p>

<p>You end the call, relieved you aren&apos;t going to spend the next few days combing through those videos. As you go to bed, you think of your dad, shuffling in his ancient blue bathrobe to take his nightly bath. You can  only hope that no one&apos;s watching.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
