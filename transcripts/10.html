<p>You and your sister install a few hidden cameras in the house, just to  keep an eye on him. They watch the front and back door, and the kitchen, and they&apos;re designed specifically for seniors. According to the  pamphlets, they can sense a fall coming and keep track of whether your dad is taking his medications. The cameras can&apos;t actually do anything about those things, of course, but they can alert you and emergency services if something really bad happens.</p>

<p>You feel bad intruding on your father&apos;s privacy, but you remind yourself  that at least this way he gets to stay in his own house, and avoid the robots.</p>

<p>Soon enough, the cameras confirm your worst fear: he&apos;s still driving. One day, you watch, horrified, as his car backs out of the driveway. You  try to talk to him about it on the phone, to tell him that if he needs a  ride, he can just call you. But he claims he&apos;s not driving. You can&apos;t tell if he&apos;s lying, or if he just doesn&apos;t remember.</p>

<p>Then one day he calls you, frantic.</p>

<p>&quot;I NEED YOUR HELP. I&apos;m stuck in the car.&quot;</p>

<p>You jump out of your chair. &quot;Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m at home but I&apos;m stuck in the car. I can&apos;t get out. I need you to come here and let me out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>He&apos;s panting on the other line, struggling. &quot;No, I&apos;m not hurt. I&apos;m stuck! I&apos;m stuck! I can&apos;t get out!&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re already halfway to your car. &quot;Okay, okay. I&apos;m on my way; I&apos;ll meet you there. Don&apos;t panic.&quot;</p>

<p>You break several laws trying to get to him, wracking your brain about how he could possibly be stuck in the car. Had he flipped it somehow? Driven into a tree? Something worse?</p>

<p>When you get to his house, the car is parked serenely in the driveway, not a scratch on it. Your father is asleep behind the wheel, his head tilted back, mouth open. You gently wake him.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey dad, so, what&apos;s the problem?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh uh, what?&quot; He glances around, groggily, before remembering. &quot;Oh! I&apos;m  stuck! A strap has trapped me! See?! This strap is trapping me! I can&apos;t  get out!&quot;</p>

<p>The door is unlocked; everything is fine. You realize he&apos;s forgotten what a seatbelt is. You reach over to unbuckle him, and bring him inside.</p>

<p>&quot;Dad, remember how you&apos;re not supposed to drive?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have places to be!&quot;</p>

<p>You eye his keys on the table, but he catches you and snatches them away, glaring, as he walks into the other room.</p>

<p>You rub your temples. You can&apos;t have him driving -- he&apos;s only going to hurt himself, or someone else. Maybe if you took on some additional work  you could afford an aide for him around the house, to help him out. It would cost about $3500 a month. Then again, you&apos;re stretched thin enough  as it is, and Imani&apos;s husband recently lost his job so collectively you&apos;re even more strapped for cash than usual â€” surely you could find a way to stop him from driving yourself?</p>

<p>So, what do you do?</p>
