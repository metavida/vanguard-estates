<p>You decide not to worry your dad about the details of how exactly Missy works. You&apos;re not sure he could fully grasp the technology anyway.  You&apos;re frankly not even sure you do.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, he becomes best friends with Missy. He brings her everywhere, propping her up on counters and tabletops, setting her in the passenger seat of the car he&apos;s not supposed to be driving anymore. He talks to her, tells her jokes, tells you stories about all the funny things she said.</p>

<p>It&apos;s kind of sweet. But you can&apos;t quite shake the worry that it might also be kind of creepy. He doesn&apos;t know that there&apos;s a person on the other end. He also doesn&apos;t know that you can log in remotely and watch him through that same camera.</p>

<p>Every so often, you check in. And sometimes, you hear him tell Missy things you&apos;ve never heard before. One day, he leans up close to the cat&apos;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;Missy, I need to tell you something very important.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s that, Marcus?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My wife…&quot; he whispers.</p>

<p>He pauses, and as he does, Missy generates a photo of your mom that you&apos;ve loaded into the app. She does this regularly to provide your dad with reminders of his life, to help him manage the dementia. He looks at  the photo lovingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, Sasha, she was so beautiful. But… there was another woman. Just a  few times. Mary, her name was Mary, I think. I visited her a few times.  Sasha never knew. I wish I had told her, before … but now it&apos;s too late.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a good person, Marcus. I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>This is what Missy is programmed to say when she senses that a client is  getting sad.</p>

<p>You&apos;re stunned. An affair! A woman named Mary! You immediately want to turn on your microphone to ask him questions, but of course you don&apos;t.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, your dad confesses other new things to Missy. How he once wanted to be an astronaut. How his first kiss was at a Rush concert. How just last week he got gas from the local gas station without paying because he&apos;d forgotten his wallet and he didn&apos;t want to admit he was forgetting things.</p>

<p>A few days later you get a call from a police officer. Your dad is in jail. The charge: petty theft.</p>

<p>Over the phone with the precinct, you learn that the app behind Missy is  required by law to report crimes it hears about. Your dad&apos;s story about  stealing gas triggered the system, which transcribed the conversation and sent it over to the police, who showed up the next day to arrest him. Missy was a rat! A 92 year old man, in jail for stealing a few gallons of gas to save his pride.</p>

<p>You get in the car to go bail him out. On the way you practice your speech. Dad, you&apos;re going to say, remember: you can&apos;t trust robots.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
