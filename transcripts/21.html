<p>You&apos;ve never been great with money, but you&apos;re smart enough to know that taking out another loan is going to be a huge pain. A long term pain. But somehow, the future pain of a loan feels worth it to handle the overwhelm of the present, the reality that you&apos;re not really equipped to take care of your dad.</p>

<p>At breakfast, you tell your father that you&apos;re looking into some options  to pay for home care. You try to be vague so he doesn&apos;t worry. It&apos;s depressing and soul sucking and terrifying, but you do look into it, and  eventually take out the best loan you can find (which might not be the best loan there is, honestly, it&apos;s hard to tell). When the money hits your bank account, you book appointments with some potential caregivers.</p>


<p>Even with the loan, you can&apos;t afford for the caregiver to work whole days, but you find a lovely woman named Mei who comes by and helps in the mornings. She&apos;s quiet but firm. She hates small talk. But your dad actually listens to her, which grants you time to work and study. You try not to think about the money too much, but it&apos;s hard when your mailbox is crammed full of ads from random loan companies, trying to con  you into their latest high interest scam. You throw them all in the trash, cursing whichever company sold your information to the vultures.</p>

<p>A few months later, Mei slides a letter at you across the kitchen counter. She points at it like it&apos;s potentially full of Anthrax, and scowls at you like you&apos;re trying to murder her. You don&apos;t recognize it, and you tell her so, but she points again.</p>

<p>When you open it, your stomach drops. Your father&apos;s name is at the top, above an account number. And there&apos;s an overdue balance, bold and red. $2,845.43.</p>

<p>You bring the letter to your dad and ask him if he recognizes it. He looks proud.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah! You mentioned needing help paying for Mei. I did a bit of research and found a good deal.&quot;</p>

<p>You try to explain to your dad that the deal he got was not, in fact, good. Doing a little math, you realize that the loan was originally for $600, with 555% interest. You&apos;ve never had a poker face, and your dad can tell you&apos;re not as proud as he thought you&apos;d be.</p>

<p>&quot;I helped!&quot; he shouts. &quot;You never let me do anything, but this was something I could do. I helped you find money for this. For Mei. For me.&quot;</p>

<p>He looks helpless on top of being angry. You try not to think about how feeble he seems, how thin and bony his hand is gripping the letter. The same hand that signed that awful loan document, his pen probably shaking  as he carefully scrawled out his name. You drop it, thanking him for his help. Once he&apos;s gone back to watch TV with Mei, you write the check for $2845.43.</p>

<p>$3,000 isn&apos;t a complete dealbreaker; you can take it out of your meager savings. But now it&apos;s yet another item in your endless running ledger of  costs. That night you pull up your own spreadsheets. You calculate that  at this rate, you&apos;ll be in debt for at least another decade. No matter how you calculate things, it&apos;s clear that you&apos;ll be paying off your father&apos;s care for years after he dies.</p>

<p>You try to focus on the other things that you&apos;ll have to remember him by, but with the red numbers glowing back at you on your spreadsheet, it  can feel like this will be his primary legacy for you after he&apos;s gone. And you can&apos;t help but feel like it&apos;s not the only debt you might never be able to repay.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
