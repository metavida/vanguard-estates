<p>You have a new routine now. Every morning you log in to the Vanguard Estates app on your phone and you &quot;Drop-In.&quot; Just to see what the robots  are doing, obviously.</p>

<p>So far, it&apos;s been pretty boring. The robots check in every day at around  10am. You can&apos;t really tell if it&apos;s the same robot every time, or if it&apos;s different ones, because they all look the same to you. Some of them  seem like they have different voices, but you can&apos;t always hear them talking.</p>

<p>Your dad eats the same breakfast every day — the same one he always made, even when you were a kid. Toast with peanut butter, black coffee, and an apple. He leaves his dishes in the sink and they disappear at some point. You&apos;re confident he&apos;s not doing them. He sits on the couch, and puts his feet up on the coffee table. He reads his books about conspiracy theories. Sometimes he guffaws at the pages — which becomes an oddly soothing, familiar sound.</p>

<p>It feels a little bit like watching a nature cam installed at a zoo. Like you&apos;re watching bears gorge themselves on salmon, but with more robots and familial guilt.</p>

<p>You can see his calendar on the app; he&apos;s got lunch plans and movie nights, and he seems happy.</p>

<p>A few months in, you spill coffee on your laptop, and the prepper-sized bag of rice you bought a couple of years ago is finally put to use. You spend most of the day wondering if it&apos;s too soon to check on just how soggy your computer is, and completely forget to check in on your dad. By the evening, when you finally get the thing booted up again, despite the distinct waft of coffee smell coming from the keyboard, you decide to see what your father is up to.</p>

<p>He&apos;s getting ready for bed, shuffling around the apartment in his ratty blue bathrobe and turning off the lights. As he heads to his room, you notice a small blue flame in the kitchen. He&apos;s left a burner on. You almost laugh; you&apos;d think such a high-tech place would have safeguards in place for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Your dad gets into bed, and the blue flame flickers. You can activate your mic and talk to him, but up until now you&apos;ve been silent. He doesn&apos;t know you&apos;re watching.</p>

<p>So, what do you do?</p>
