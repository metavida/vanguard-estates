<p>You talk to your advisor about the situation, and make arrangements to  defer your masters for another year. You watch your classmates get internships and amazing job offers. You try to tell yourself that you&apos;ll  be there too, someday. You&apos;re not exactly sure how long your dad will be with you. It&apos;s not that you hope he&apos;s gone in a year, but in the darkest moments of the night, you admit that maybe you do. Just a little. Then you feel terrible about daydreaming about his death. He&apos;s still your dad, even if he feels like a stranger most days. And so the cycle continues.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t help that everything keeps getting harder. You&apos;re around more  now, so you can see each step in his slow descent. When you&apos;re feeling kind, you try to remember that this must be terrifying for him. You try to feel kind as much as possible, but sometimes it&apos;s hard. Imani makes it clear that she has no sympathy for you at all. You talk less now than  you did before, which is saying something. Everybody else either nods and tries to change the subject, or waxes poetic about how few kids these days uphold their duties to their parents. Neither reaction makes you feel better.</p>

<p>One night, you wake to a sharp yelp and the smell of fire. You had dozed  off after refusing to make him a grilled cheese sandwich at 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, and he tried to make one himself. Angry and holding his singed wrist, he lashes out.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the cat?!&quot;</p>

<p>It takes you a second to figure out the question. You don&apos;t have a cat. You&apos;ve told him this already.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you&apos;ve hidden the cat! You hate that the cat likes me better, don&apos;t you? You never could stand being the least favorite.&quot;</p>

<p>That one hurts, but you try to stay calm. He&apos;s been doing this more, suddenly latching onto an idea and holding tight. You try to talk him down, tell him that the cat is sleeping. That maybe it&apos;s time for all of  us to go to bed.</p>

<p>&quot;No! I know you&apos;re keeping the cat in a cupboard or something. Which is animal abuse. The cat has done nothing wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>He starts throwing open the cabinets and tearing things out of them — boxes of mac and cheese, cans of beans, a package of hotdog buns — searching for a cat you don&apos;t have. You&apos;re exhausted, adrenaline still pumping from the fear that your father had seriously hurt himself and potentially set your house on fire. You&apos;re in over your head and it&apos;s two o&apos;clock in the morning and he&apos;s destroying your kitchen and you&apos;re not proud of it, but you start yelling back. Cursing him for saddling you with this responsibility, for not having anybody else to go live with, for not appreciating everything you&apos;re trying to do for him. He&apos;s screaming back at you, for hiding the cat, for not being Imani, for forcing him to live with you, for not making a grilled cheese for lunch.</p>

<p>You&apos;re not even sure how the next moment happens, but he suddenly lunges  at you. You react on instinct, shoving him to the ground, hard. It&apos;s not until he&apos;s lying on his back, frail and panting, the whites of his eyes reflecting the overly bright kitchen light, that you realize what&apos;s  happened.</p>

<p>He&apos;s not hurt. But you don&apos;t sleep another moment that night. Your hands shake as you lay in bed, fumbling with your phone, scrolling through forums for people in your position, caring for their own parents with dementia with no training or support. It&apos;s heartening to know you&apos;re not  alone, but nobody has any real answers beyond: get richer somehow so you can pay for help.</p>

<p>The next morning you apologize to your father. He doesn&apos;t remember anything, despite the red welt on his wrist from the stove. He does ask why the kitchen is such a mess, though.</p>

<p>So you begin again, another day, hoping this one goes a little better. Reading more forums. Confiscating more cleaning supplies. Reminding your  father of who you are. Wondering how many more days you have to do this  for.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
