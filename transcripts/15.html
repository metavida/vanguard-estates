<p>You&apos;re glad you decided to bring someone in to help your dad bathe, but it wasn&apos;t easy to find a fit. Your dad doesn&apos;t like the first few people you hire, and when you do eventually find someone he does like, they quit six months later. Senior care pays so poorly these days, and is such a demanding job, that most people don&apos;t last more than a few years.</p>

<p>He goes through three more people until finally, you find a good match. A  big guy named Sven. Your dad likes Sven. He talks just enough, and about the right things: football and world war two history.</p>

<p>The quest is over. Until, a few months later, you get a call.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, kiddo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How&apos;s it going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today was Sven&apos;s last day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, why? What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He got hired in California at one of those big fancy retirement homes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m sure we can find another good one.&quot;</p>

<p>Your dad pauses for a moment. &quot;You know, I married your mother 40 years ago. Before that, I was in love only once. With a girl named Mary. She was Italian. It was never going to work out. Not because she was Italian. She liked those woven baskets, and festive candles, and camping. But when you&apos;re young and in love, you know, you&apos;re foolish. Anyway, we went on a few dates. Then I met your mother. I asked her to marry me after five dates.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re not really sure where he&apos;s going here, but you&apos;ve gotten used to him rambling on the phone. You start to organize your laundry while he carries on.</p>

<p>&quot;The point I&apos;m trying to make is that I&apos;m not good at dating. I&apos;m out of  practice. I usually get dinner before I let someone see me naked. You know?&quot;</p>

<p>You don&apos;t really know.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you want to get dinner with Sven?&quot;</p>

<p>He huffs a laugh. &quot;No. That&apos;s not the point. I don&apos;t want any more strangers in my house, looking at me naked.&quot;</p>

<p>You take a deep breath, and get ready to explain to him again that he isn&apos;t allowed to bathe himself at Vanguard. The protocol once a resident  falls is really strict. But before you can he cuts you off:</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve been talking to some of the other residents here, and some of them  have this thing â€¦ A bath bot? Do you think... I think I&apos;d like one of those instead. I mean I don&apos;t know how much they are, but... do you think we could do that?&quot;</p>

<p>You have to laugh; after all your stress about making sure he gets human  care! You tell him you can DEFINITELY do that. I mean, they&apos;re cheaper than the humans he&apos;s been using!</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve been using!&quot; He shoots back. &quot;You&apos;re the one who&apos;s set me on a series of naked blind dates!&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re already pulling up the Vanguard Portal on your computer to change  his settings and request a bath bot installation. You tell him you&apos;ll order one right then.</p>

<p>&quot;Great, thanks kiddo. Love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love you too, dad.&quot;</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
