<p>You navigate through the series of menus and panels to get to the well-hidden &quot;Disable Drop-In&quot; option. Your dad thought that the new cell phone towers were tracking him, you can only imagine what he would think if he found out that his kids were spying on him through a camera in the ceiling.</p>

<p>You go back to the main page, where you can toggle through a growing list of information. Some of it is basic medical stuff: height, weight, medications. Other stuff is more detailed -- there&apos;s a running heart rate and blood pressure meter, which means they&apos;ve outfitted him with some kind of wearable device. You can see steps ticking up -- he must be  walking around right now. There&apos;s a tab for nutrition -- calories consumed, time of day, type of food, nutritional value.</p>

<p>There&apos;s also a tab called &quot;Social,&quot; where over the next few weeks you watch your dad&apos;s calendar slowly fill up. Book clubs, movie nights, lunches with new friends. You can even read a transcript of each conversation and a detailed breakdown of how many words he said, the complexity of those words, and how balanced the conversation was.</p>

<p>One afternoon, he got into an argument with a robot about whether it was  playing the version of the Rush song that he asked for. Then there was the time he tried to flirt with another resident. It did not go well.</p>

<p>You try not to read these transcripts too often, but it&apos;s hard to resist. They give a picture of your dad that you&apos;ve never seen before --  the way he talks to people when you&apos;re not around.</p>

<p>Then, one morning, after Dad has spent nine months at Vanguard Estates, your phone starts to buzz in a way you&apos;ve never felt before. Three long buzzes and one short one. Your home screen is filled with a big red box.</p>

<p>*HEALTH ALERT — Fall Detection.*</p>

<p>The Vanguard App provides the basic details – he slipped while getting out of the shower. No immediate serious injury. Robotechs were on the scene in one minute and forty seven seconds and got him to the hospital in under twenty minutes. You call your sister, and you both head over, a  thunderstorm beating at your car&apos;s weary roof.</p>

<p>When you get to the hospital, your dad is confused. He&apos;s not quite sure where he is, or why. You can&apos;t tell if it&apos;s the Alzehimers or a head injury.</p>

<p>In the hallway, you&apos;re met by a tall woman in a polo shirt with the Vanguard Estates logo on it. This is the first human you&apos;ve met who works for them. You make a joke about how perhaps she&apos;s secretly just a really fancy robot. She doesn&apos;t laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;The hospital doesn&apos;t allow our bots inside, so it is my job to liaise between residents and the facility. Once a resident has a fall, the services in their portfolio change. The checkin bots that you&apos;ve met will come by more frequently. Residents who&apos;ve entered into the high risk category for falling also can&apos;t bathe alone. They can be assisted by a robot, or by a human aide. The robot assistant is included in your package, the human would be an additional monthly fee of $1,200.&quot;</p>

<p>You turn to your dad to see what he thinks. He just looks at you. He doesn&apos;t even seem annoyed, just far away. This is maybe your least favorite part of watching him decline. He always used to have opinions about everything. He joked that it was his hobby to have thoughts, even when he had no business judging a situation. But now he just watches you  the same way he was watching the water run down the windows earlier.</p>

<p>The Vanguard Estates Representative is watching you too, not even pretending to busy herself with paperwork to buy you time. Your sister gives you a pointed look and glances at her watch. She has kids to pick up in an hour. It&apos;s time to make a decision: opt for robotic baths, or shell out extra money for human ones?</p>

<p>So, what do you do?</p>
