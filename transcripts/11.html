<p>Your house is not really big enough for two adults, especially not when one of them doesn&apos;t want to be there. And there&apos;s only one bathroom. And you&apos;re trying to work and finish your masters degree at the same time. You coordinate for movers to bring your dad&apos;s stuff over from Vanguard, so now the house feels overly packed. Kind of like you&apos;ve  been overzealous at the soda fountain and you&apos;re trying to put the top on and spilling soda all over your hands.</p>

<p>Your father and you have always had a strange relationship. You&apos;re the fun one, the one who used to sneak him cigarettes when he was trying to quit, the one who stayed up late listening to his records and trash talking your neighbors. You always had fun together, but you were never close. You chose antics over deep conversations—you were always in motion, always getting up to something so that neither of you really had  to talk about what was on your mind.</p>

<p>You certainly aren&apos;t an expert in caring for someone with dementia, but you&apos;re pretty sure that antics are not part of the care plan.</p>

<p>At first, things go okay. It&apos;s kind of fun, even. You play card games, and you can&apos;t tell if he&apos;s cheating or if he can&apos;t actually remember the  rules or where the game play was. You pull out his old record collection and dance around to his favorite songs. You even start recording some of his old stories. You suspect most of them are, let&apos;s say, &quot;highly embellished,&quot; but it&apos;s still fun.</p>

<p>But the honeymoon phase doesn&apos;t last long.</p>

<p>It starts at night, with a knocking on your door. He&apos;s up all the time, it turns out. And he&apos;s bored, and often a little bit confused about where he is. At first you assume he&apos;ll settle down, find a routine, and stop waking you up every couple of hours. But he doesn&apos;t. You realize that often he doesn&apos;t even know what time it is. He asks for lunch at 1am, thinking it&apos;s 1pm.</p>

<p>Next come the mood swings. Fast and strong and very uncharacteristic of your dad. One second you&apos;re laughing together about some annoying neighbor; the next, he&apos;s scowling and lashing out at you for being &quot;judgemental and rude.&quot;</p>

<p>The changes are exhausting, and frustrating, but you soldier on because they&apos;re not exactly dangerous. But that doesn&apos;t last either.</p>

<p>One day, while you&apos;re at work, he tries to rearrange the furniture in the house, convinced that things aren&apos;t where they were supposed to be. He becomes convinced that there are spiderwebs everywhere, and that your  house is always dirty. You&apos;re not a neat freak, but the house is certainly not covered in spiderwebs. Most days when you get home from work, exhausted, you find your father vacuuming, sweeping, or glaring into a corner, mumbling about how he should have raised a neater child. Sometimes you find him tangled in the vacuum cord, struggling against it. Other times you find him with too much bleach in a bucket. Enough bleach that you start to worry.</p>

<p>Being out of the house all day is starting to seem less and less safe. He really shouldn&apos;t be left alone that long. But you still hold out hope  that maybe his cleaning phase will pass. Maybe he&apos;ll go back to his conspiracy theory books, settle into reading on the couch, and stop touching your bleach. You need your job to pay off your student loans, and you need this masters degree to get a better job to pay off the rest  of your bills. And it&apos;s not just the money — you love your job. You&apos;re finally making headway on a career, impressing your bosses and feeling like maybe you&apos;ve found your calling.</p>

<p>And yet, you realize that your current setup with him simply isn&apos;t working. He needs more attention, either from you or someone else. But your choice is to either give up something you want very badly, or take on additional debt.</p>

<p>So what do you do?</p>
