<p>You realize that you have no backup plan. All of your dad&apos;s stuff is here, and the last time he lived with you… it did not go well for either  of you.</p>

<p>You sigh in defeat. Your sister lifts her chin, and turns to the robot.</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re ready to sign, thank you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My pleasure, Imani. Ring anytime you need anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Great, it knows her name. It probably knows your name, too, but you don&apos;t want to test it and find out.</p>

<p>You leave your dad on the couch. He&apos;s already settled in, reading a book  about the latest JFK assassination conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>When you get home, you fish out the flyers you grabbed on the way out and sit down in front of the computer. You should probably figure out exactly what you just agreed to.</p>

<p>On the homepage for Vanguard Estates there are two big buttons -- FAMILY  and RESIDENTS. You click Family, and a screen pops up prompting you for  a login, which of course Imani already sent you in an email that you mostly skimmed.</p>

<p>Once you&apos;re logged in, you can see a big, smiling photo of your dad and some basic information — hobbies, favorite books, TV shows, whether he&apos;s  a dog or cat person. It almost looks like a dating profile. You chuckle  at the idea of your dad finding love again. Maybe he&apos;ll fall for a robot. Maybe the facility has sex robots for the residents. They did say  it was full service. You make a mental note to text Imani about this, only because you know it will annoy her.</p>

<p>On the right side, a button catches your eye, distracting you from thinking about sex robots for your father. Which is probably a good thing. The button says &quot;Drop-In.&quot;</p>

<p>You click, and up pops an image of your dad&apos;s apartment. He&apos;s on the couch, asleep with his annoying JFK book resting open on his chest. It takes you a second to realize that you&apos;re watching a live feed, from a camera somewhere in the ceiling.</p>

<p>You quickly close out the window. That&apos;s spying! Isn&apos;t it?</p>

<p>You read the fine print below the button.</p>

<p>&quot;Drop-In is automatically enabled on all rooms. To disable Drop-In mode,  click here.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems creepy to be able to spy on your dad, without him knowing. Then  again, you did just leave him in the care of robots, so maybe it&apos;d be good to keep an eye on things.</p>

<p>So, what do you do?</p>
