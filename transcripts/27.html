<p>You don&apos;t tell him. What good would it do? You don&apos;t even know if his footage is up there anyway.</p>

<p>The conversation moves on, and you talk about your job. His friends at Vanguard. The upcoming movie night. How much he hates whoever picks the movies for said movie night. You sign off promising to call again next week, and to smuggle him some of his favorite contraband candies when you visit next.</p>

<p>After your call, the transcript is added to his file under the &quot;Family Contact&quot; tab. There&apos;s a green smiley face next to it, indicating that the algorithms have determined that the conversation was a positive one.  &quot;Resident happiness is directly correlated with positive family contact,&quot; the page cheerily reminds you. Apparently the bots haven&apos;t quite figured out how to tell when that family contact is lying.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
