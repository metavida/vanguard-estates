<p>You let it go and cross every finger and toe that your father doesn&apos;t get chlamydia. He&apos;s being checked out regularly by doctors anyway, right? Surely they&apos;d catch it, especially if it&apos;s going around.</p>

<p>For a while, you cringe every time you click Drop-In, praying to a god you don&apos;t believe in that you don&apos;t witness a repeat. And you don&apos;t. Dad  keeps you up to date on his days, and slowly you start to hear the same  name more and more in his stories. Patricia. They play cards together. He says she always cheats. You remind him that he cheats every time you&apos;ve ever played cards. They go to movie nights, and she has opinions about cars and prog rock that you don&apos;t really understand but nod along to.</p>

<p>You tease him a little about her, at first. Ask when you&apos;ll get to meet her, to give her the &quot;get my father home by curfew speech&quot; he delivered to your dates so many times. Then one day, when you Drop-In, he&apos;s not alone. There&apos;s a woman on the couch next to him, fiddling with her hands. He introduces her with a sheepish smile and sits down next to her, handing her a mug of tea.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it might be time for you to meet Patricia,&quot; your dad says, fidgeting.</p>

<p>Patricia is slight, with a crisp white bob. She answers your questions with short, clipped sentences.  At first you think she&apos;s maybe a little bit mean, until you realize that she&apos;s nervous. Your father leans into her a little bit, cracks a joke about some mutual friend of theirs at Vanguard that you don&apos;t really understand, and you see her shoulders relax a little. You smile, too, trying to convey as much warmth in your voice as you can. As the conversation loosens up, you learn about her—her kids, her jewelry refurbishing business that she still runs out of Vanguard, her dislike of tomatoes and her love of cats.</p>

<p>When she mentions that she hates scented candles, you jokingly ask your dad when the wedding will be, and he gets a serious look on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;We have thought about it.&quot;</p>

<p>He takes Patricia&apos;s hand.</p>

<p>&quot;But I thought, you know, maybe you&apos;d think it was… too soon.&quot;</p>

<p>He sounds nervous. Like he&apos;s waiting for you to laugh at him. Your mother died when you were twenty, and your father never remarried. You always thought that was romantic, but now, watching your father grin sheepishly at this tiny woman by his side, you wonder if you should have  encouraged him to get out more. To meet someone like her earlier. Before the end was so close.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you come? If we did something small? You don&apos;t have to, I know you&apos;re busy. It&apos;s a silly thing, really. It&apos;s fine.&quot;</p>

<p>It stings a little that your dad thinks you might not come to his wedding. Even if it&apos;s a silly thing. Which it&apos;s not, you realize. He&apos;s met someone who makes him happy. Who he wants to spend the rest of his time with.</p>

<p>You tell him you&apos;ll be there, no matter what.</p>

<p>Your dad and Patricia have a little ceremony a few months later. You help him pick out a ring for her. There&apos;s a robot DJ, and you give a speech in front of everyone that does not include the time you accidentally saw your father and Patricia doing it on the couch. Even Imani seems moved by the whole thing.</p>

<p>Patricia dies a few months later from pancreatic cancer, and your father follows shortly after. You have their wedding vows printed out and hang them up in your house. You hope that one day you&apos;ll find a love like that, a love that was the right thing at the right time, no matter how short lived it might be.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
