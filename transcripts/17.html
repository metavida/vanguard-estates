<p>You try to let your father down easy. Well, that&apos;s not strictly true. First you try to avoid the question for a little longer. But then he mentions that he&apos;s been pricing out flights, and you realize he might buy himself a ticket and disappear on you. And that&apos;s when you try to let him down easy.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t go well. You feel like you&apos;re crushing his dreams. In fact, he tells you you&apos;re crushing his dreams. He pulls the &quot;I might not have much longer to live&quot; card more than once. And he&apos;s not wrong. You call Imani for backup, but even though for once she agrees with you, her bedside manner leaves something to be desired. By the end of the call, you&apos;re all shouting at each other.</p>

<p>Somehow the conversation is no longer about a trip to Manila, but about everything. All the things you&apos;ve decided for your father. All the things he hates about his life, his condition. The way he&apos;s losing control, the way you&apos;ve taken control from him. Imani screams at you for  taking him away from Vanguard, and he screams back at her that he&apos;s happier at home with his friend Manny. Imani is convinced Manny is out for money, or his kidneys, or both. You try to point out that our father&apos;s kidneys probably aren&apos;t worth very much, and apparently that&apos;s the wrong thing to say.</p>

<p>Dad threatens to go to Manila anyway. Imani threatens to camp out outside his home. At some point, you hear the robotic cat in the background asking if everything is okay. There&apos;s more yelling.</p>

<p>Towards the end you put the phone down and lay your cheek down on your crappy kitchen counter and close your eyes. You can still hear them arguing, but it&apos;s reached the stage where the two of them just have to exhaust themselves. The sound becomes a kind of stressful white noise. Your mind drifts away to your own future. Your own eventual decline. Your own currently nonexistent children who might try, in the future, to  do the right thing, but struggle and maybe even fail. You hope they don&apos;t hand you over to robots. You make a note to put that somewhere in a  will you don&apos;t currently have.</p>

<p>The argument winds down, and it finally ends the way these things always  do.</p>

<p>&quot;Good chat,&quot; Imani sighs.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s one way to put it,&quot; your dad shoots back, but with no venom left  to put into it.</p>

<p>&quot;Talk to you next week?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love you, dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love you too.&quot;</p>

<p>They hang up, having forgotten about you. Which is normal, and this time, oddly reassuring.</p>

<p>A month later, your father dies peacefully in his sleep. He leaves everything to Manny.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
