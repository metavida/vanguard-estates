<p>You decide to trust the bots. Isn&apos;t this the point of all of this technology and data and monitoring? Better care? Maybe they&apos;ve caught something you missed.</p>

<p>But a few months later you visit, and your dad is totally different. He&apos;s tired, removed, suddenly uninterested in talking about things he once loved to lecture you about. You try to poke him by making a joke about the moon landing being fake. Nothing.</p>

<p>Maybe it&apos;s the new drugs? He&apos;s on so many of them now, and you&apos;re not even sure what each of them does. In the app it lists what he&apos;s taking, and when, and how much, and all the ways they&apos;ve supposedly improved his  health. But the data doesn&apos;t line up with what you saw.</p>

<p>After the visit, you call your sister. She&apos;s noticed too, but she&apos;s not quite ready to jump to conclusions. You have a long conversation about how to tell if it&apos;s the drugs, or his decline. She cites numbers at you, life expectancy post diagnosis, meta-reviews of various treatment protocols. But in the end, you just can&apos;t shake the memory of your dad, more withdrawn than ever before, mumbling about how they really should landscape better at the facility even though it&apos;s the dead of winter and  everything is covered in snow.</p>

<p>Eventually, you decide to object. There&apos;s got to be a less drug-intensive way to take care of him.</p>

<p>You call Vanguard&apos;s medical help line.</p>

<p>*&quot;Welcome to the Vanguard Estates medical information portal. Please enter your resident&apos;s eight-digit identification number.&quot;*</p>

<p>You punch in his id number.</p>

<p>*&quot;Thank you. Marcus Jones is currently taking:&quot;</p>

<p>Memantine, 15mg daily Donepezil, 10mg daily Galantamine, 24mg daily Metoprolol, 50mg daily</p>

<p>For more information about this prescription plan, press one. To speak with a healthcare advocate about this prescription plan, press two.&quot;*</p>

<p>Yes, you decide you would like to speak to a healthcare advocate. As the  phone rings, you really hope that whoever answers is a person.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Vanguard Estates medical, this is Amy speaking. How may I help you?&quot;</p>

<p>You breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, yeah, I&apos;m calling about my dad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marcus Jones, is that correct?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep, that&apos;s him. I&apos;ve noticed that you&apos;ve added a couple medications to  his list recently, and I&apos;m just wondering if I can get my dad off of some of them? I just don&apos;t think they&apos;re helping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand your concern. Vanguard Estates policy states that family members aren&apos;t authorized to make changes to the medical plan for any resident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he&apos;s my dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand that.&quot; Amy is good at her job, and she makes it sound like  she really does understand where you&apos;re coming from. But then she goes on. &quot;Vanguard Estates policy states that family members can&apos;t make changes to medical plans. I can direct you to the medical release forms you signed that explain the policy in more detail, if you like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I can&apos;t make any changes, ever, at all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s correct. The release form clearly states that all medical decisions are made using state-of-the-art medical technology and in consultation with the world&apos;s best doctors, and are non-negotiable. It&apos;s  in the best interest of the patient to stay consistent with our care plans. You can request a formal review, but there is a waitlist that&apos;s currently… about 17 months.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;re feeling flustered. &quot;So what you&apos;re telling me is that your facility&apos;s robots can give my father whatever medication they want, and there is nothing that he or I can do about it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t describe it that way… but yes, that is essentially the policy.&quot;</p>

<p>You weigh your options here. You could argue with her, but you doubt Amy  can do much for you. You think about asking for her supervisor. But instead, you ask Amy a question.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you let your parents live at Vanguard Estates, Amy?&quot;</p>

<p>She doesn&apos;t answer right away, and when she does it&apos;s diplomatic. &quot;I can&apos;t really answer that question. Is there anything else I can help you  with today?&quot;</p>

<p>You sigh. &quot;No, I guess there isn&apos;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right then, have a great day!&quot;</p>

<p>The conversation replays in your head over and over again for the next week. You think you should have been more forceful. Maybe you should get  Imani to call. She was always better at standing her ground. Customer service calls made you jumpy, anxious, easily flustered. But in the end it doesn&apos;t matter. Your father dies two weeks after your call with Amy. The last full conversation you have with him, the last glimpse of his old self, is when he&apos;s ranting about his neighbor cheating at poker.</p>

<p>You make sure there are no candles, or robots, at his funeral.</p>

<p>**THE END**</p>
