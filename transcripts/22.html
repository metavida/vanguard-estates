<p>You click the mic button and clear your throat, ready to give this robot your best professionally intimidating voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, do you really think he needs another medication?&quot;</p>

<p>Your dad turns and stares at the ceiling, clearly confused. You can explain yourself later. The robot turns to face you.</p>

<p>&quot;I am fully licensed to evaluate residents and administer medication. Please see the terms and conditions of Vanguard Estates to learn more.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course you didn&apos;t read the terms and conditions. You lean into the computer&apos;s microphone.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t care what you&apos;re licensed for. My father doesn&apos;t need another medication.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your vocal signature clearly indicates that you are distraught. High stress experiences can trigger our residents with dementia.&quot;</p>

<p>The robot moves towards you. It&apos;s a smooth but startling movement. The robot&apos;s screen, which usually just shows blue clouds or another soothing  image, is now pulsing red. A warning that only you can see.</p>

<p>&quot;If you cannot calm down, I am going to have to end this session.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;CALM DOWN?&quot; You bark. &quot;Do not tell me to calm down!&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, your screen goes black.</p>

<p>A soothing voice breaks the silence. &quot;Our system has detected a dangerous situation for one of our residents. Your session has been terminated, and the Drop-In function has been locked for 12 hours. For more information, or to apply for reentry, call 1-800-DROP-INS.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, you&apos;re stunned. Then you&apos;re enraged. You grab your phone and dial the number. You don&apos;t envy whatever robot or human winds up picking up the line.</p>
