<p>You watch as he shuffles into the bedroom and closes the door. After a  few seconds, the stove turns off. This place is smart after all. Maybe it&apos;s time to trust them a little bit more.</p>

<p>The next morning you Drop-In at your regular time. The usual robot wheels in to say hello. Or maybe it&apos;s a different robot. You still can&apos;t  tell.</p>

<p>You listen as the bot asks its regular set of questions.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you feeling today, Mr. Jones? How did you sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>Your father&apos;s voice is flat when he answers. &quot;Well enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you felt confused at all recently?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only about just how many clones of Queen Elizabeth there really were.&quot;</p>

<p>The robot doesn&apos;t get the joke. Or at least, you&apos;re pretty sure it was a  joke. Then again, your dad did recently tell you that he had a conversation with a TV host and that someone on the radio was trying to sell his couch without his permission. You can&apos;t see his face, to tell if he&apos;s got his left eyebrow raised or not â€” his usual joke giveaway. You wonder if robots understand eyebrow raises or not. There&apos;s probably a  whole algorithm for that, right?</p>

<p>The bot carries on with its questions. &quot;Does this confusion distress you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, clones are very upsetting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for your answers, Mr. Jones. I am going to add Donepezil to your daily prescription regimen. Please inform me if you feel any adverse effects.&quot;</p>

<p>You feel a flash of anger take you by surprise. Your dad&apos;s already taking a bunch of different medications, and you&apos;re pretty sure the combination has made him more sluggish. Should they really be adding another? Should a robot really be making that kind of choice based on a single possible joke about clones?</p>

<p>You reach for the mouse, to step in and stop the robot from adding another medication, but before you click, you pause. This is what you&apos;re  paying the big bucks for, isn&apos;t it? Predictive care, quantified and calculated by robots who are always watching. And frankly, you&apos;re still not sure if your dad is joking about the clones or not.</p>

<p>So, what do you do?</p>
