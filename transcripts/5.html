<p>You and your sister alternate calling every other day, and visiting every other weekend.  Your dad tells you often how happy he is to be in his own house, which makes you feel better about the choice to take him home.</p>

<p>But now that you&apos;re talking to him more, your dad&apos;s dementia has also become far more noticeable to you. He tells you stories about seeing boats sail by his house even though there&apos;s no river nearby. He&apos;s convinced his old cat is still around, even though she died years ago. He&apos;s even started to vacuum the house, to make sure he picks up all her non-existent hair.</p>

<p>As the months wear on, you and your sister start to suspect that your dad isn&apos;t being totally honest about his days. He says he&apos;s not driving,  he says he&apos;s taking his medicine, but some of his stories don&apos;t add up.  How did he get lunch with Carl the other day? You didn&apos;t schedule anybody to come pick him up. You can&apos;t tell if he never got lunch with Carl at all, or if he drove himself to Carl&apos;s house. Both would be bad.</p>

<p>Your sister finally confronts you.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t think this is enough,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>She&apos;s right, and it&apos;s time for you to admit it. Just calling every day and visiting every weekend isn&apos;t going to work.</p>

<p>She pulls up her list of techno fixes, the same ones she walked you through before. A surveillance camera, an app, an in-home robot. There&apos;s  a whole spectrum. You discuss the pros and cons of each. And at the end, she broaches one last option.</p>

<p>&quot;He could live at Vanguard Estates. I can reapply. He&apos;s already approved, they&apos;d just need to find an open unit for him. I don&apos;t think we can still get the same pilot deal, but I can try.&quot;</p>

<p>You sigh. &quot;No… no, no. I still don&apos;t feel like that&apos;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can&apos;t just say no to everything. You have to offer an alternative. He can live with you, or you can hire an in-home aide. I&apos;m trying here, but you&apos;re just eliminating options and I … I&apos;m done. Okay? I offered to  pay for Vanguard, I&apos;ll buy the tech stuff, but if you&apos;re going to insist on saying no to everything then you&apos;re gonna have to figure it out on your own. Call me when you have something to say other than no.&quot;</p>

<p>She hangs up on you.</p>

<p>You hate to admit that she&apos;s probably right. This status quo isn&apos;t working. But surely there&apos;s an option better than hiding cameras in the bookshelves to watch him? How much can a home health aide really cost?</p>

<p>An hour later you lay your head on the laminate countertop in your kitchen. It&apos;s peeling, and smells a little weird no matter how many times you scrub it. Turns out, home health aides can cost a lot. Like, $120,000 a year a lot. A lot more than you have. More than even Imani has. More than Vanguard Estates would have been, it turns out. That pilot program deal was really good. Damnit.</p>

<p>Your options seem clearer now. If you don&apos;t want him at Vanguard, you can either upgrade the home tech setup to watch over his home, or you can move him into your place, so you can keep an eye on him.</p>

<p>So what do you do?</p>
